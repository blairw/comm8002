## Box and Whisker Plots

### Basic info

- One of the basic visual outputs from SPSS
- Simultaneous visualisation of central tendency and spread for multiple datasets (if placed side by side and with the same scale)
- Interval/ratio on the y-axis, categorical on the x-axis
- Outliers are defined as less than one quarter range from the box
- You can comment on dataset A being "significantly different" from dataset B if dataset A doesn't overlap with dataset B in terms of box: even if outliers (whiskers) overlap, the bulk of the datapoints don't overlap
